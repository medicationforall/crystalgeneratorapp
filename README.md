# CadQuery Crystal Generator - Streamlit Gui

 Streamlit App using code from [cqterrain](https://github.com/medicationforall/cqterrain) to generate parametric crystal terrain. 
 
I created this application https://crystalgenerator.streamlit.app/ to help with the technical barriers and allow for an interactive demo.

The streamlit application allows you to define the dimensions of your Crystal terrain.
